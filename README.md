A simple test project built in React to pull data from New York City's CitiBike station API and render it conditionally.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

1. After cloning the repository, run `npm install` inside its directory.
2. Run `npm start` to initialize the server. It will be available on `localhost:3000`
